<p>I don't agree with you that frameworks aren't needed   Your example is indeed "simple".   For example, It would fail if the strings you are outputting had commas or quotes in them. A framework (like POI) would handle those issues without you even being aware of them.</p><p>Admittedly, CSVs are fairly lightweight... and don't have as many of these sorts of issues as other formats, but why re-invent the wheel?</p>

<p>And if you have a double quote in one of your fields?  This is fairly simple to deal with but it should be mentionned.  Replace all double quotes in any field with two double quotes, and enclose the whole in double quotes.  The safe thing to do is always write one's fields out enclosed by double quotes.</p>

<p>Hi mkyong....<br>Srry it was simple...<br>I did cast it to string and use it :)<br>But however i could not append the time stamp(date + time) value. The timestamp value format is of YYYY:MM:DD HRS:MIN .....<br>But when appending it is only giving HRS:MIN value i.e the time value but the date value is completely lost :(</p>

<p>hi no name,</p><p>    Ya, i agreed with you, my function above is quite simple and it is not enough to cover all CVS functionality. However what i want to bring out is, we can generate the CVS file by simple output it as text file.<br>   If we have a comma(,) , we need to use double quote (") to enclose it.</p><p>For example</p><p>   "No , name", 23</p><p>   Thanks for bringing this to my attention, :)</p><p>P.S Please refer to this link for CVS detail</p><p><a href="http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/...</a></p>
